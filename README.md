# Odin binary search tree

## An exercise in the creation of a binary search tree

It's time to extend upon my knowledge of data structures by building a Binary Search Tree(BST)
A binary search tree is a non-linear data structure, a binary tree in which nodes that have a lesser value than the root is stored on the left of the root. And higher values on it's right.

During the course of this exercise, I've come to leverage alot of the techniques and methods I learned in previous exercises involving things like merged sort, in its way to handle an array, splitting it in two and sorting it in order. As well as linked lists, and the techniques to traverse them.

All of this culminated in this.

A balanced binary search tree
